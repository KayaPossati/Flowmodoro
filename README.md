# Flowmodoro

A simple upgrade from normal pomodoro timer mixed with the flow method for studying.

The flowmodoro technique helps you study combining the state of flow, when you lost track of time, with the pomodoro timer thats to rigid and doesn't help when trying
to follow a train of thought, but you have periods of time to relax and take a break from the task.

Using this timer you can still have the track of time to knows how long is past, and the needed time to have a break thats equivalent of the time you have spent in the flow (1/5 of the total time)
